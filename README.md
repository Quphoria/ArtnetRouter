# Artnet Router

This is for routing Artnet/Sacn universes to Artnet/Sacn universes.  

It allows switching banks of universes to different sources, e.g. A/B  
As well as recording/playing back presets.  
It also has support for an Emergency scene for when the source stops transmitting for a period of time.
