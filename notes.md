# Config

All config stored in large json file, maybe break into multiple files to split it up a bit

The broadcast option for sacn is actually for enabling multicast (as sacn only supports multicast and unicast)

# Scenes

All scenes stored in a database (maybe sqlite), as storing in a json file is dumb
